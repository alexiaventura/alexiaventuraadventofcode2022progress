# adventofcode2022
These are my attempts to solve some Advent of Code problems in December 2022, and I was able to solve 12 of them with my coding experience. They got too challenging for me to continue solving, but I aspire to be able to solve more as I continue improving my coding skills. I'm also very proud of myself for what I HAVE managed to solve, nevertheless; I was pleasantly surprised to see that I now have enough coding knowledge to work with some long file input. I'm uploading my solutions onto Github to document my progress as a programmer.

"adventofcodeday_.py" files: the Python program files for my solutions
"adventofcodeday_question" files: have the coding questions
"puzzle_.txt" files: have the input I needed to use in my program

_ is used in place of a number like 1, representing the day that the specific question was released (Day 1 if the number is 1, for example).

I fully solved the questions from Days 1-6 (meaning I solved both parts of each). I came up with partially-completed solutions for the first parts of Days 7 and 8, and decided to upload those as well.
